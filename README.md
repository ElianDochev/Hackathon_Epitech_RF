### How to create the dataset

#### 1. Download the dataset from Radio France

#### 2. Extract the dataset into directory `data`

#### Note: the root directory should look like this:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”œâ”€â”€ extract_cvs.ipynb
â”œâ”€â”€ parce_file_sys.ipynb
â””â”€â”€README.md
```

#### 3. Run the `parce_file_sys.ipynb` notebook and `extract_cvs.ipynb` notebook

#### Note: they will create the extracted training data in diretory `results4`. Previous results directories are just for testing purposes.
